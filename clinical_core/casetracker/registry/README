The classes here are classes that link python to the customizable casetracker classes.

In particular, Category, Status, and EventActivity.

A Category governs how a case is managed, displayed, viewed, and linked to other objects.

A Status describes the state of a case of a certain category, as the states need to be unique and referenced in a way unique
to the needs of the Category.

The Activity is where additional functionality needs to be defined for managing a case.
State can be controlled by the activity as well as how the view/user interaction is controlled can be done
via the activity
