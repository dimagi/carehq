Things won't work immediately because of haystack integration. To make things work, you need to run the following commands:

easy_install django-haystack
easy_install pysolr

This should be enough to get django to stop complaining. To actually be able to run the search features, you have to download and set up solr. Download it from here: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/ . To run it, you don't actually have to install it. Just do the following:

cd apache-solr-1.4.1/example/
java -jar start.jar

That should get the server running at http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr . Then you need to configure it for ashand and rebuild the index:

cd [...]/ashand
python manage.py build_solr_schema > schema.xml
mv schema.xml [...]/apache-solr-1.4.1/example/

Restart the solr server and then build the index:

python manage.py rebuild_index

That should be it. In the future if you want to get the index up to date, you can run

python manage.py update_index

(In a deployment setting, this command would be repeated automatically at regular intervals)
