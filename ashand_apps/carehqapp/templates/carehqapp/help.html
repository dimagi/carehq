            <h4>For the Caregiver</h4>

            <p>Thank you for participating in our study!</p>

            <p>Your participation will help in our efforts to develop a better communication tool for caregivers
            like you helping patients receive their care.</p>

            <p>
            The patient you are caring for will have received a monitoring device installed in their home.
            This device will ask series of questions asking they are feeling. These questions are typical
            side effect questions related to cancer treatments they have taken in the past. They will be
            asked these same questions every week day (Monday to Friday) at the specified time of their
            request. The total time for their using this system will be 4 weeks since the time of installation.
            Note, the questions your patient will be answering should only be answered as part of a
            simulation. </p>

            <p>
            If they are truly feeling sick, they should contact their health provider immediately.
            We have encouraged the patient to use the system to simulate a time in which they were
            undergoing treatment, and were suspect to the side effects being asked. Your participation with
            using the website is to give you a chance to track your patientâ€™s day to day feeling using our
            electronic system.
            </p>
            <p>
            All the answers provided by your patient will be sent to a website (<a href="https://ashand.dimagi.com">https://ashand.dimagi.com</a>)
            where you will have an account setup. The answers that your patient will give will trigger
            electronic issues that the BMC careteam will need to address on the website. These issues
            will also be made available for you to view as well via the website. The BMC careteam will be
            respond to the issues generated to demonstrate how it would be in a real scenario.
            There will be two surveys given during the 4 week time. One at 2 weeks time and another at
            4 weeks time to assess your impressions of the system. You will receive notification during
            those times to fill out these surveys. You also may interact with the system however you are
            comfortable with during the 4 weeks of the study.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you have any questions regarding the functioning of the system, do not hesitate to contact me,
            Dan, the study coordinator. I can be reached via email (<a href="mailto:dmyung@dimagi.com">dmyung@dimagi.com</a>) or phone at 617-
