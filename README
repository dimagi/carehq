ASHand Overall project structure.

Some runtime notes.

settings.py - the basic django settings for the ashand project, which can now be run as a pure django project.
settings_default.py - Additional specific settings that you should consider setting.
not visible are settings_local.py which you should set for your specific settings.  These are ignored by git.

If you want to do some basic testing of patients and a demo setup, run these commands:

python manage.py syncdb #create the databaase
python manage.py runscript loadfixtures #register basic static content into the database
python manage.py register_categories #registers the categories already baked in via the CaseRegistry framework
python manage.py runscript random_load #generates some basic case information for review


It'll prompt you to blow away your database, only do this if you want to populate the db with lots of dummy data.
The providers in the system will largely be comprised of Star Trek doctors and nurses.  All patients will be comprised of other television characters.
