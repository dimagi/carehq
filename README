ASHand Overall project structure.

Some runtime notes.

settings.py - the basic django settings for the ashand project, which can now be run as a pure django project.
settings_default.py - Additional specific settings that you should consider setting.
not visible are settings_local.py which you should set for your specific settings.  These are ignored by git.

to run pure django bootstrap, run the management commands via djmanage.py
to get access to the rapidsms bootstrap, run the rsmanage.py

For 99% of your usage, you should use the djmanage.py

If you want to do some basic testing of patients and a loaded setup, run:
python djmanage.py runscript ashandapp.scripts.demo_load

It'll prompt you to blow away your database, only do this if you want to populate the db with lots of dummy data.
The providers in the system will largely be comprised of Star Trek doctors and nurses.  All patients will be comprised of other television characters.
