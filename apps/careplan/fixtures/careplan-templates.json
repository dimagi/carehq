What was I doing when I had pain?&nbsp; \r\n<LI><STRONG>Quality </STRONG>-&nbsp;What does the pain feel like? Is it knifelike and stabbing, or dull and constant?&nbsp; \r\n<LI><STRONG>Location</STRONG> - Where is the pain?

Does this make the pain worse?&nbsp;</LI></UL> \r\n<P>If your pain has been undiagnosed, your healthcare provider may order certain tests or examinations based on your pain. This may include x-rays, CAT Scans, bone survey or scan, or an MRI. Your healthcare provider will order the exams that are right for you.&nbsp;</P> \r\n<P>If you already have a source or cause for your pain, it is important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations. Also, continue to keep a pain diary, and chart your progress.</P> \r\n<P><STRONG>Other Things you can do:</STRONG></P> \r\n<P dir=ltr style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\"><STRONG>Keep your bowels moving.</STRONG> People in pain tend to move around less, drink less fluid, and become constipated from pain medications that slow down the movement of food through your stomach. This is easily treated by:&nbsp;</P> \r\n<UL> \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>Increasing your daily intake of fresh fruit and fiber. Prunes, and prune juice may work for some individuals. It is important to move your bowels daily. \r\n<LI>If you do not move your bowels every day, your health care provider may prescribe stool softeners and laxatives to help prevent constipation. Work with your healthcare provider to develop a regimen that will work for you.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>Drink 2 to 3 quarts of fluid every 24 hours, unless you were told to restrict your fluid intake. This will decrease your chances of being dehydrated, which can lead to constipation. \r\n<LI>Increase your activity, if tolerated.&nbsp; </LI></UL> \r\n<LI>People with pain, who may not be taking deep breaths, need to circulate air from the bottom of their lungs and out of your lungs (oxygenation), to prevent infection and pneumonia. Using an incentive spirometer for 15 minutes a day, twice a day, can help promote oxygenation. \r\n<LI>Physical therapy is important. Try to exercise, as tolerated, to maintain your optimal level of functioning.. Exercise, in persons with bone problems, will help promote strengthening and bone remodeling (repair). Discuss with your healthcare provider how you can create a specific exercise program to suit your needs. Make sure to exercise, under the supervision of your healthcare provider. Walking, swimming, or light aerobic activity may help you to lose weight, and promote the flow of oxygen in your lungs and blood (oxygenation). \r\n<LI>If you have back pain, or pain due to bone problems, braces or assistive devices (such as walkers or canes), may help. \r\n<LI>If you can locate your pain, especially if it is muscle related, warm compresses may help.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>Occupational therapy (OT): you may be taught in OT how to do many tasks that you normally do, in a more effective manner.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>People who have constant pain are often overly tired. To minimize excessive tiredness (fatigue) due to pain or cancer chemotherapy:&nbsp; \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>You should ask yourself:&nbsp; Am I experiencing fatigue? If so, how severe is it on a 1-10 scale?&nbsp; Is it interfering with my ability to function? \r\n<LI>It is important to weigh the value of certain activities.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>If you feel anxious, use relaxation techniques to decrease the amount of anxiety you have. Place yourself in a quiet environment, and close your eyes. Take slow, steady, deep breaths, and try to concentrate on things that have relaxed you in the past. This is called behavioral therapy.</LI></UL> \r\n<LI>Participating in support groups may be helpful to discuss with others what you are going through. Ask your healthcare provider if he or she is aware of any support groups that would benefit you. \r\n<LI>If you are ordered a medication to treat this disorder: \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>Do not stop taking any medication unless your healthcare provider tells you to.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>Take the medication exactly as directed.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>Do not share your pills with anyone. \r\n<LI>Many medications to treat pain may cause you to feel dizzy or drowsy.&nbsp; Do not operate any heavy machinery unless you know how the medication will affect you.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>Antacids, such as Mylanta<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>, Pepcid<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>, Nexium<SUP><FONT size=2>TM </FONT></SUP>(and others, may change the way many medications are absorbed. If you have any questions specific to medications that may have been ordered for you, ask your healthcare provider.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n<LI>If you miss a dose of your medication, discuss with your healthcare provider what you should do.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>If you experience symptoms or side effects, especially if severe, be sure to discuss them with your health care team.&nbsp; They can prescribe medications and/or offer other suggestions that are effective in managing such problems. \r\n<LI>Keep all your appointments for your treatments.</LI></UL></LI></UL> \r\n<P><STRONG>If You Are Prescribed Medication To Treat Bone Pain:</STRONG></P> \r\n<P>Depending on your overall health status, your doctor may recommend that certain drugs be used to help decrease your bone pain.&nbsp; Some of the common drugs that are used to treat bone pain may include:</P> \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI><STRONG>Antibiotics</STRONG> - If your doctor or healthcare provider suspects that you have an infection (such as osteomyelitis) that may have caused your bone pain, he or she may order antibiotics, either in a pill form or intravenous (IV). If you are prescribed antibiotics, take the full prescription. Do not stop taking pills once you feel better. \r\n<LI><STRONG>Anticonvulsants</STRONG> - these medicines are used in the treatment of chronic (long-term), nerve related pain in adults. \r\n<LI>When there is nerve injury present anywhere in the body, certain pain receptors may create new nerve endings. The threshold for pain (the point at which you experience pain) related to the nerves, may be decreased. Therefore, pain may be noticed while you are at rest, or while you are moving, when these nerve endings are irritated.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>The exact way that the anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin<STRONG> </STRONG>(Neurontin<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>) works to prevent nerve related pain is unknown, but it is thought to decrease nerve pain at certain cell receptor sites, by decreasing your response to nerve pain. \r\n<LI>&nbsp;<STRONG>Anticonvulsants</STRONG> can be referred to as an \"adjunct\" medicine, meaning, it is used with another medication to make it work better. Many patients, in addition to gabapentin, will be on a narcotic pain reliever, such as oxycodone, or morphine sulfate. These medications will work together to better control your pain, each working in a different way. \r\n<LI><STRONG>Antidepressants</STRONG> - are used to treat depression and pain in adults. People who have pain for a long period of time (chronic), become tired and depressed. \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>Certain nerve signals, when activated, make pain worse, and cause more depression. Serotonin and norepinephrine are important conductors of nerve signals (neurotransmitters), which are found in the central nervous system (CNS). The places that these neurotransmitters work are highly important. These neurotransmitters contribute to depression.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>Medications, such as venlafaxine (Effexor<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>) works by blocking the \"reuptake\" of&nbsp; the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, thus decreasing your depressive symptoms.&nbsp; </LI></UL> \r\n<LI><STRONG>Bisphosphonates</STRONG> - Cancer cells that spread to the bone can secrete (produce) substances that can cause other cells found in the bone, called osteoclasts, to dissolve or \"eat away\" a portion of the bone.&nbsp; These tumors or lesions weaken the bone and can lead to complications.&nbsp; Some of the complications resulting from this bone breakdown are bone pain, fractures and less commonly, hypercalcemia (increased levels of calcium in the blood). \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI> \r\n<P>Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate (Aredia<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>), and zoledronate<STRONG> </STRONG>(Zometa<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>) may be used to treat hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), and to decrease pain. Pain can be decreased by: </P> \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>Preventing bone destruction or damage. \r\n<LI>Preventing bone from being \"eaten away.\" \r\n<LI>Which will also prevent bone fractures or breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI></UL></LI></UL> \r\n<LI><STRONG>Corticosteroids</STRONG> - Corticosteroids work by decreasing inflammation (swelling) in many areas of the body. The corticosteroids prevent infection- fighting white blood cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) from traveling to the area of swelling in your body. This means you are more prone to infection while on steroids.&nbsp; \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>You may be taking steroids if you have a cancer that has spread (metastasized) to your spine, brain, or bone. \r\n<LI>Steroids will decrease the swelling in areas where tumors are located, which may decrease the pressure of the tumor on your nerve endings, and decrease your pain.</LI></UL> \r\n<LI><STRONG>Narcotics</STRONG> -The central nervous system (CNS) is a way for our brain to send messages to our body in a timely manner. It is highly alert, especially when we are experiencing pain.&nbsp; Many narcotic analgesic (pain medicines) work by blocking these messages, such as morphine sulfate and oxycodone. \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI>Make sure you discuss with your healthcare provider common side effects, such as constipation, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, and how to control these side effects.&nbsp; </LI></UL> \r\n<LI><STRONG>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) agents and Tylenol</STRONG><SUP><FONT size=2><STRONG>&#174;.</STRONG> </FONT></SUP>If you are ordered a medication to treat this disorder - such as naproxen sodium and ibuprofen, may provide relief of musculoskeletal pain.&nbsp; \r\n<LI>If you are to avoid NSAID drugs, because of your type of cancer or chemotherapy you are receiving, acetaminophen (Tylenol<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>) up to 4000 mg per day (two extra-strength tablets every 6 hours) may help.&nbsp; \r\n<UL> \r\n<LI><EM>It is important not to exceed the recommended daily dose of Tylenol<SUP><FONT size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP>, as it may cause liver damage.

      "description": "<p>\r\nDiarrhea is frequent, loose, or watery bowel movements. It may be caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy to the pelvis, or by the cancer itself. Diarrhea may also be caused by graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in people who have received a bone marrow transplantation. Diarrhea may be described according to the following stages, from mild to severe, established by the National Cancer Institute:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stage 0 is increased stool frequency, but no diarrhea.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 1 is an increase of less than four stools a day.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 2 is an increase of four to six stools a day or nocturnal (nighttime) stools.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 3 is an increase of more than seven stools a day, or incontinence, or a need for intravenous (IV) fluids to treat dehydration.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 4 is a severe condition that requires intensive care.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nPreventing diarrhea or treating it early can help a person avoid becoming dehydrated or developing other problems. The following suggestions can help manage mild (stage 1 or 2) diarrhea:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, dairy, fat, fiber, orange juice, prune juice, and spicy foods.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid laxatives, metoclopramide (Reglan, used to prevent vomiting and constipation), and stool softeners.</li>\r\n<li>\r\nEat small, frequent meals.</li>\r\n<li>\r\nDrink plenty of water and other liquids to prevent dehydration. People with severe dehydration may need to receive IV fluids.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask your doctor about changing the schedule or dose of chemotherapy if the diarrhea is caused by chemotherapy and is severe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAsk your doctor about antidiarrheal medications. Octreotide (Sandostatin) can be used to treat diarrhea caused by chemotherapy. No drugs have been approved for preventing diarrhea caused by radiation treatments to the pelvic area, but some are being studied. If diarrhea continues after you have made changes to your diet, opioid medications may help to relieve diarrhea.</p>"

For most people, a healthy diet includes:</p> \r\n \r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Lots of fruits and vegetables, and whole grain breads and cereals</li> \r\n<li>Modest amounts of meat and milk products</li> \r\n<li>Small amounts of fat, sugar, alcohol, and salt</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n \r\n<p>When you have cancer, though, you need to eat to keep up your strength to deal with the side effects of treatment. When you are healthy, eating enough food is often not a problem. But when you are dealing with cancer and treatment, this can be a real challenge.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>When you have cancer, you may need extra protein and calories. At times, your diet may need to include extra milk, cheese, and eggs. If you have trouble chewing and swallowing, you may need to add sauces and gravies. Sometimes, you may need to eat low-fiber foods instead of those with high fiber. Your dietitian can help you with any diet changes you may need to make.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><a href=\"#top\" class=\"backtotop-link\"><img src=\"/images/backtotop_red.gif\" alt=\"Back to Top\" border=\"0\">Back to Top</a></p> \r\n \r\n<p class=\"header-A\"><a name=\"2\"></a>Cancer treatment can cause side effects that lead to eating problems</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Cancer treatments are designed to kill cancer cells. But these treatments can also damage healthy cells. Damage to healthy cells can cause side effects. Some of these side effects can lead to eating problems.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Common eating problems during cancer treatment include:</p> \r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Appetite loss</li> \r\n<li>Changes in sense of taste or smell</li> \r\n<li>Constipation</li> \r\n<li>Diarrhea</li> \r\n<li>Dry mouth</li> \r\n<li>Lactose intolerance</li> \r\n<li>Nausea</li> \r\n<li>Sore mouth</li> \r\n<li>Sore throat and trouble swallowing</li> \r\n<li>Vomiting</li> \r\n<li>Weight gain</li> \r\n<li>Weight loss</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n \r\n<p>Some people have appetite loss or nausea because they are stressed about cancer and treatment.

It is important to have a healthy mouth before you start cancer treatment.</li> \r\n<li>Ask your doctor, nurse, or dietitian about medicine that can help with eating problems.</li> \r\n<li>Discuss your fears and worries with your doctor, nurse, or social worker.

Once treatment ends, many eating problems go away. Your doctor, nurse, or dietitian can tell you more about the types of eating problems you might expect and ways to manage them.

For many people, this is in the morning. You might want to eat a bigger meal early in the day and drink liquid meal replacements later on.</li> \r\n<li>Eat those foods that you can, even if it is only one or two items. Stick with these foods until you are able to eat more. You might also drink liquid meal replacements for extra calories and protein.</li> \r\n<li>Do not worry if you cannot eat at all some days. Spend this time finding other ways to feel better, and start eating when you can. Tell your doctor if you cannot eat for more than 2 days.</li> \r\n<li>Drink plenty of liquids. It is even more important to get plenty to drink on days when you cannot eat. Drinking a lot helps your body get the liquid it needs. Most adults should drink 8 to 12 cups of liquid a day.

This is most important when preparing raw meat, chicken, turkey, and fish.</li> \r\n<li>Use one cutting board for meat and one for fruits and vegetables.</li> \r\n<li>Thaw meat, chicken, turkey, and fish in the refrigerator or defrost them in the microwave. Do not leave them sitting out.</li> \r\n<li>Cook meat, chicken, turkey, and eggs thoroughly. Meats should not have any pink inside. Eggs should be hard, not runny.</li> \r\n<li>Do not eat raw fish or shellfish, such as sushi and uncooked oysters.</li> \r\n<li>Make sure that all of your juices, milk products, and honey are pasteurized.</li> \r\n<li>Do not use foods or drinks that are past their freshness date.</li> \r\n<li>Do not buy foods from bulk bins.</li> \r\n<li>Do not eat at buffets, salad bars, or self-service restaurants.</li> \r\n<li>Do not eat foods that show signs of mold.

At the time of diagnosis, 30% to 40% of people experience pain. If the cancer has spread, 65% to 85% of people experience pain, and up to 95% of cancer pain can be treated successfully. Pain can make other aspects of cancer seem worse, such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, nausea, constipation, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and mental confusion.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>However, not all people with cancer benefit from pain relief strategies because they don\u2019t share the symptoms with their health care team or have worries about the medications used to relieve pain. It is important to communicate with your doctor and nurses about your pain so they can develop a plan to relieve it.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Causes</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>Pain can come from the tumor itself or may be a result of cancer treatment.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>The tumor.</b> If a tumor grows and spreads to the bones or other organs, it can put pressure on nerves and damage them, causing pain. If cancer spreads or grows around the spinal cord, it can cause a compression of the spinal cord, which can lead to severe pain or paralysis if not treated.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Surgery.</b> It is normal to experience pain from cancer surgery. Most pain goes away after a while, but some people may have persistent pain for months or years from permanent damage to the nerves.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Radiation therapy.</b> Pain may develop after radiation therapy and go away on its own. It can also develop months or years after treatment, especially after radiation therapy to the chest, breast, or spinal cord.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Chemotherapy.</b> Some chemotherapy can cause pain along with numbness in the fingers and toes. Usually this pain goes away when treatment is finished, but sometimes the damage is permanent. <a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=Peripheral neuropathy =\"\">Learn more about peripheral neuropathy</a>.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Diagnosis</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>You know your own pain best. The doctor's job in managing pain is to listen to you, believe you, offer a solution, and keep repeating this process as long as the pain lasts. Your doctor may ask the following questions about your pain:</p> \r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Where it hurts<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>When the pain stops and starts<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>How long it has been there<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>How intense the pain is</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n \r\n<p>The doctor may also ask you to describe the pain using a scale from 1 to 10 or offer words that help describe the pain, such as burning, stabbing, or throbbing.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Managing pain</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>Doctors can treat pain in several ways:</p> \r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Fixing the source of pain, such as treating the tumor or reducing inflammation<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Changing the perception of pain, usually with pain-killing medications<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Interfering with pain signals sent to the brain, through spinal treatments or nerve blocks</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n \r\n<p>Depending on the source of the pain and the person's health, there are many different combinations of medications and ways to give them. Most doctors know how to manage most pain, most of the time. Sometimes, pain and palliative care specialists (specialists who care for the physical, spiritual, psychological, and social needs of a person with cancer) are available as a resource to help patients manage more intense pain.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Pain medications</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>ASCO recommends the use of the <a \"http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/painladder/en/\" targer=\"_new\">pain treatment ladder</a> developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Using this system, mild to moderate pain is treated with mild painkillers (analgesics), and if the pain increases to moderate or severe, it is treated with opioid drugs, such as morphine. Pain medicines can be given in different ways, depending on the drug and the patient's overall condition:</p> \r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>By mouth (oral)<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Under the tongue or inside the cheek<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Under the skin<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Into the veins (intravenous or IV)<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Into the spine or area around the spine<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>By rectum</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n \r\n<p>Often doctors will give patients a device where they can control the release of medicine into their own body, called patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Pain medications are often given around the clock, with appropriate \"rescue\" doses for pain that surges suddenly through regular pain medications (called breakthrough pain).</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Side effects</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>Pain medication, especially opioids, can cause <a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=constipation =\"\">constipation</a>, <a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=nausea =\"\">nausea</a>, <a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=sleepiness =\"\">sleepiness</a>, <a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=confusion =\"\">confusion</a>, or hallucinations. Many side effects can be prevented (such as constipation) or treated with other medications. In some situations, a doctor may switch to another drug to minimize these side effects.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Managing pain without medication</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>Many people have found that other methods besides medication help control pain. Your doctor may be able to help you manage pain using more than one method. Make sure you share with your doctor what methods have previously worked for you.</p> \r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Physical therapy or occupational therapy can help you use devices, such as prostheses, splints, or braces to help ease pain.<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Relaxation, distraction, hypnosis, or biofeedback (a method where people use their minds to control a response from their body, such as heart rate)<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Nutritional support<br> \r\n<br> \r\n</li> \r\n \r\n<li>Acupuncture</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n \r\n<p>Your doctor or a pain specialist can help you learn more about these methods for controlling pain.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><i><b>More Information</b></i></p> \r\n \r\n<p><a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=managing and treating cancer pain =\"\">Managing and Treating Cancer Pain</a></p> \r\n \r\n<p><a \"vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid/alt=Managing Side Effects =\"\">Managing Side Effects</a></p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Additional Resources</b></p> \r\n \r\n<p>Lance Armstrong Foundation: <a \"http://www.livestrong.org/site/c.khLXK1PxHmF/b.2660619/k.8284/Chronic_Pain.htm\" target=\"_new\">Chronic Pain</a></p> \r\n \r\n<a \"http://www.cancersymptoms.org/pain/key.shtml\" target=\"_NEW\">Cancersymptoms.org: Pain</a> \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p> "

Skin problems can be especially difficult for a person to cope with because they can cause such visible changes to his or her body.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Skin problems can be acute (occurs briefly, then goes away) or chronic (remains over time). The best way to manage skin problems is by preventing them, if possible. For this reason, it is important to let your doctor and nurse know as soon as you have any sores, wounds, pain, rash, or other problems with your skin and nails so that treatment can begin right away.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>With most skin problems, the doctor must decide if healing the wound is a realistic goal. If it is not, then containing it and keeping the patient as comfortable and pain-free as possible becomes the goal.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Some common skin problems experienced by people with cancer are listed here:</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Chemotherapy extravasation.</b> This is the term used to describe chemotherapy that has leaked out of a vein. The drugs can damage the skin where the intravenous (IV) tube was placed or the tissue around the area where it touches, causing pain or burning. Pain or burning during chemotherapy may not be normal, and you should tell the nurse or doctor right away. If an extravasation occurs during treatment, the infusion should be stopped and the wound cleaned. The nurses and doctors will care for the wound and instruct you on how to care for it at home.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Radiation-induced treatment skin problems.</b> When radiation treatment kills cancer cells, it also kills some healthy cells. When it kills cells on the skin, it can cause the skin to peel. Damage to the skin from radiation treatment can start after one or two weeks of treatment and usually resolves a few weeks after treatment is finished. If skin damage from radiation treatment becomes a problem, the doctor may change the dose or schedule of treatments.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Necrotic wound.</b> This is a wound with dead skin or tissue around it. A necrotic wound cannot heal if the dead tissue is still present. A process called debridement, which removes the dead tissue, is the first step in treating this type of wound. Debridement may involve surgery, enzymes or gel, or other methods recommended by your doctor.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Pressure ulcers (bed sores).</b> Pressure ulcers are sores that form where there is constant pressure on one area of the body. They often form on the heels of the feet or the sacrum (tailbone). Ulcers are less likely to form on parts of the body where there is a thicker layer of fat.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>For patients who are confined to a bed, an air or water mattress overlay may help prevent ulcers. Low-air-loss beds or air-fluidized beds may also help. For pressure ulcers that are not expected to heal, the doctor or nurse can provide comfort and pain control and prevent the ulcers from getting worse.</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Malignant wounds.</b> These injuries form when cancer breaks the skin and causes a wound. A malignant wound can be caused by cancer from another part of the body or from skin cancer. These wounds may have a foul odor, bleed, and can be very painful.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Malignant wounds carry a high risk of infection. They may also leak a large amount of fluid or blood. The odor from a malignant wound can be overpowering and can be managed by placing an odor absorber in the room, such as cat litter, charcoal, or by introducing another odor, such as a burning candle, vanilla, vinegar, or coffee. (Fragrances and perfumes can be irritating to the patients, and these methods should be avoided).</p> \r\n \r\n<p><b>Pruritus (itching).</b> Pruritus in people with cancer is most often caused by leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, or other cancers.
